# Fishies

(Created in Eclipse)

Based on the flash game Fishy, this small clone focuses on using a convincingly function-based method known as "big-bang" 
supplied by Javalib to progress the game forward one frame at a time. 

Control the Player fish with arrow keys and press spacebar to halt momentum.

Grow your fish by moving Player over smaller fish and watch it increase in size accordingly!

Win: Become the biggest fish in the pond
Lose: Eaten by a bigger fish
